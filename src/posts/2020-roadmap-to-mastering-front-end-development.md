I have been a full-stack developer for over 5 years. And while i have plenty of experience in front-end development, i believe the road to mastery is a separate road. And it's not something you can achieve without a plan.

And here i am trying to create a plan for myself to attain mastery. But first, let's try to define mastery.

# What is mastery?

Wikipedia defines mastery as a "high level of a skill". And there are many ways to attain it:

* **Martial-arts ðŸ¥‹**: apprenticeship, constant practice, extremely slow practice, katas ...
* **Arts & sciences ðŸ”¬**: observation, reading, experience, practice, teaching, writing ...
* **For Babies ðŸ‘¶:** focused, motivated, lengthy (several dozens of minutes) & repeated practice, observation & [absorption](https://archive.org/details/absorbentmind031961mbp/page/n8), admiration & fascination, seeking independence ...

While we all laugh from books with titles like "Master spanish in 40 days without a teacher". But it's exactly what babies do. Not only that, they master a language (or two), walking, equilibrium, running, dancing, singing ... (we can go on endlessly).

> The uncontested master of masters is the child !

So I'll be learning from the Child along my journey. And my guide to this is a women i respect immensely, a doctor and a great scientist, [Maria Montessori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Montessori) who is well known for her pedagogy method and her writings on scientific pedagogy.
