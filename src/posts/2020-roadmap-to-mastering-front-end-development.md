I have been a full-stack developer for over 5 years. And while i have plenty of experience in front-end development, i believe the road to mastery is a separate road. And it's not something you can achieve without a plan.

And here i am trying to create a plan for myself to attain mastery. But please bare with me, let's try to define mastery first.

# What is mastery?

Wikipedia defines mastery as a "high level of a skill". 

And there are many ways to attain it:

* **Martial-arts ðŸ¥‹**: apprenticeship, constant practice, extremely slow practice, Katas ...
* **Arts & sciences ðŸ”¬**: observation, reading, experience, practice, teaching, writing ...
* **For Babies ðŸ‘¶:** focused, motivated, lengthy (several dozens of minutes) & repeated practice, observation & [absorption](https://archive.org/details/absorbentmind031961mbp/page/n8), admiration & fascination, [the conquest of independence](https://archive.org/details/absorbentmind031961mbp/page/n138) ...

While we all laugh from books with titles like "Master Spanish in 40 days without a teacher". It is exactly what babies do. Not only that, they master a language (or two), walking, equilibrium, running, dancing, singing, the use of their hands ... (we can go on endlessly).

> The uncontested master of masters is the child !

So I'll be learning from the Child along my journey. And my guide to this is a women i respect immensely, a doctor and a great scientist, [Maria Montessori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Montessori) who is well known for her pedagogy method and her writings on scientific pedagogy.

> Mastery doesn't come through learning, but rather through **education**

If you don't agree with my citation above, then who taught the child Language? his parents? a book? a video?!

I will be sharing my insights on mastery education in future posts. And we do need that in our field (Software), because there has been a big regression from the individuals who created VIM, JavaScript or Linux in a few weeks to the team of engineers which builds a buggy piece of software in dozens of months !! 

> It seems as though the Software field is of such a great power & potentiality, that even our clumsy work on it generates big value & wealth.

We're missing way more than what we're gaining. And yet Software companies are thriving like no other (in the history of humanity).

Of course, i don't deny the fabulous accomplishments that we attained. One example is Rails, its philosophy & community that "[Armed the rebels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKyv-IGvgGE)" and augmented the capabilities of developers and enabled them to do more with less. Another example would be the Elm language, which is a [carefully prepared environment](https://elm-lang.org/news/the-syntax-cliff) for developers to learn & build reliable software.

These pieces of software were written by amazing individuals & communities and shaped the industry. But the question is **How do I become like them? How do i become a master?**
