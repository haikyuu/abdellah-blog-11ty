In order to provide the best user experience for your users, you need to make the most tedious parts of your app feel good. And the most tedious thing is form filling.

The first UX one thinks of is to display errors after the users clicks on submit. But we want the user to have immediate feedback, which helps a lot in longer forms.  How do we do that in a React application? How do we know an input has been visited and that we can display errors?
